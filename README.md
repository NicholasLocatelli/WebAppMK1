# WebAppMK1
This is my first web app.
I want to develop an application that can let the user create an album for trading cards. 
## Why the need for this application?
The reason I want to create this application is because sometimes I was there sitting in my office looking at my album and I was trying to imagine how a specific pattern of card would look like in there.
One of this idea I was imaging was my album goal for the life. A national living dex with the first set which pokèmon has been released, its shiny version and an alternative art/full art of it. 
One way to create this album was by proxing each card and put'em in the album to see what cards I should buy and how many spaces each pokèmon take.
But, how you can think it is really boring and hard do all this stuff.
So why don't try to recreate this with an application? well, it doesn't exist. So, let's create it.
## What the app does?
I want an app really usefull for all users and traders around the world. So the first thing the app has to do is to create different type of album: 1x1 for jumbo cards, 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 and 4x3 for normal size cards.
One more functionalities the app has is to search for any single cards inside a database, this database contains all the cards ever printed of any single set, constantly updated.
Once you choose the album and what and where put any single card you have just created your super and unique abum. And what if...
## More and more functionalities for the future
Now that you have your album, maybe you want to have it physically in your hands, so you have to buy these cards. So the idea is to use some API to take all the cards inside the album and paste them inside cardtrader or cardamrket and order them directly.
But what you are missing? Right, the album itself. And the idea for this is to create a collaboration with an album supplier, someone like vaultX.
In this way we can create a system where you can create your album, your playlist directly on your pc and then get it to your home. 
Buying all the cards and the album can be really expensive, so I think that there will be some sort of discount for all the people that will buy directly from our site.

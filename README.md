# WebAppMK1
This is my first web app.
I want to develop an application that can let the user create an album for trading cards. 
## Why the need for this application?
The reason I want to create this application is because sometimes I was there sitting in my office looking at my album and I was trying to imagine how a specific pattern of card would look like in there.
One of this idea I was imaging was my album goal for the life. A national living dex with the first set which pokèmon has been released, its shiny version and an alternative art/full art of it. 
One way to create this album was by proxing each card and put'em in the album to see what cards I should buy and how many spaces each pokèmon take.
But, how you can think it is really boring and hard do all this stuff.
So why don't try to recreate this with an application? well, it doesn't exist. So, let's create it.
